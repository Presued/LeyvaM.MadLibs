The user will be asked a series of questions and the user will have to answer the questions to the best of there ability

Peer reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Good work with the play-again feature. The while loop was a good call for that. The ToUpper() catches any mixed-case edge cases. Overall I liked the idea of asking questions to the user and trying to string them together into a coherant story. In future revisions I'd try to guide the user to a more appropriate response because some of answers ended up making no sense. Also one or two of the variables need a space before them to fit into the story. Overall great work though! I really liked your approach to the problem
